##### v2 Breaking Changes

These things have changed and will require you to take action when you upgrade
to this version. Make sure to copy your old config file values to the new config
file format. If you use environment variables, they all need to be updated!

-   **Config file format changed.** All key names refactored for consistency.
-   **Environment variable names changed.** All key names refactored for consistency.
-   Some graphs require Grafana 6.6.0. UPGRADE.
-   All graphs require InfluxDB 1.7.x. UPGRADE.

##### v2 Updates

-   New [GitHub Org](https://github.com/unifi-poller) created for UniFi Poller. Moved from personal repo.
-   [InfluxDB output code moved to separate library](https://github.com/unifi-poller/influxunifi)
    as modular plugin. (output module)
-   [UniFi input code moved to separate library](https://github.com/unifi-poller/inputunifi)
    as modular plugin. (input module)
-   [Prometheus code moved to separate library](https://github.com/unifi-poller/promunifi)
    as modular plugin. (output module)
-   [Poller app code moved to separate library](https://github.com/unifi-poller/poller).
    The main repo only handles builds and golang vendors now.
-   [UniFi API code moved to new location](https://github.com/unifi-poller/unifi)
    from golift github org. It fits better in the new unifi-poller org.

-   Switch from `dep` to go modules.
-   Application refactored to use "registering module" approach.

-   **New dashboard: Client DPI** (for Prometheus and InfluxDB, 12 total)

-   The wiki was moved into its [own repo](https://github.com/unifi-poller/wiki) and
    attached to a build pipeline that auto deploys tested changes to the main wiki (linked above)
-   The dashboards were moved into their [own repo](https://github.com/unifi-poller/dashboards)
    and attached to a build pipeline that auto deploys them to Grafana.com.

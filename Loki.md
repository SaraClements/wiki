Poller provides support for writing UniFi's Events, Anomalies, Alarms and IDS
data to Loki. There are no dashboards for this data, but it's pretty simple.
Just add a "Logs" panel. You can also use this data as an Annotation source.
Loki support was added in UniFi Poller v2.0.2.

# Usage

Just add the Loki URL to your poller config to enable this output plugin.

```toml
[loki]
  url = "http://127.0.0.1:3100"
```

Use the UniFi input plugin settings to choose which logs to collect and save.
Example:

```toml
[unifi.defaults]
  save_ids       = true
  save_events    = true
  save_alarms    = true
  save_anomalies = true
```

# Advanced

The Loki output plugin has a few advanced settings that most folks
won't use. These are their default values.
```toml
user       = ""
pass       = ""
verify_ssl = false
tenant_id  = ""
interval   = "2m"
timeout    = "10s"
```

You can set a `user` and `pass` if your Loki instance requires
auth. This currently only supports Basic Auth. Please open an [Issue](https://github.com/unifi-poller/unifi-poller/issues/)
if you need support for something else. Alternatively you can pass
the Tenant ID header directly by setting `tenant_id`. If your Loki
instance is using/behind an SSL proxy that has a valid SSL cert you
may set `verify_ssl` to `true`. The recommended `interval` is `2m`
but anything from `1m` to `15m` should work fine.
The `timeout` is `10s`, adjust it if you get timeout errors.
